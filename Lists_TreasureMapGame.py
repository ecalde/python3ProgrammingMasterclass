# You are going to write a program that will mark a spot with an X.
#
# In the starting code, you will find a variable called map.
#
# This map contains a nested list. When map is printed this is what the nested list looks like:
#
# [['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️'],['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️'],['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']]
#
# This is a bit hard to work with. So on lines 6 and 23, we've used this line of code print(f"{row1}\n{row2}\n{row3}"
# to format the 3 lists to be printed as a 3 by 3 square, each on a new line.

row1 = ["⬜️","️⬜️","️⬜️"]
row2 = ["⬜️","⬜️","️⬜️"]
row3 = ["⬜️️","⬜️️","⬜️️"]
map = [row1, row2, row3]
print(f"{row1}\n{row2}\n{row3}")
position = input("Where do you want to put the treasure? ")

column = (int(position[0]) - 1)
row = (int(position[1]) - 1)

map[row][column] = "X"

print(f"{row1}\n{row2}\n{row3}")
